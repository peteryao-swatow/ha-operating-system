# HAOS for Sonoff iHost

This is an unofficial port of [Home Assistant Operating System (HAOS)](https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system) to run on [Sonoff iHost (Smart Home Hub Appliance) hardware by ITead](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-ihost-smart-home-hub/).

Documentation specific to this port is in this wiki -> https://github.com/darkxst/ha-operating-system/wiki/HAOS-on-Sonoff-iHost

A reason for using this port is that this hardware represents one of the most inexpensive ways to run HAOS on a decent dedicated appliance, and another reason is repurposing the hardware Sonoff iHost if you have outgrown its own built-in features, functions and supported devices.

A custom integration that enables you to control the RGB indicator and buttons on the Sonoff iHost is available [here](https://github.com/darkxst/ihost_indicator). The underlying library that powers this integration but also provide a command line tool to control the LED is available [here](https://github.com/darkxst/yc1175-indicator)

(FYI, compared to the official [Home Assistant Green](https://www.home-assistant.io/green/), Sonoff iHost comes with build-in Zigbee Coordinator, similar to [Home Assistant Yellow](https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow/)).
